Craiger
=======

Craiger is just something I'm playing with... A multi-city craigslist search with ruby. 

This project was created 2011/5/20... don't expect much yet.


Things I'd like to do
---------------------

* Group Cities into States
* Finish OptionParser implementation / Actually use options in search
* SQL integration
  - store results for retrieval later
  - spider multiple times a day but only show new results
  - stats? 
* HTML Output
* Documentation
* Maybe, _just maybe_, write some tests ;)
