Craiger
=======

Craiger is just something I'm playing with... Basically I'm shopping for a truck and wanted to browse more efficiently, so a multi-city craigslist search with ruby was necessary.


This project was created 2011/5/20... don't expect much yet.


Usage
-----

Craiger is run from the command line... like so:

    cd path/to/where/you/cloned/craiger
    ./bin/craiger [query]
    

This is where some OptionParser magic will come into play...



Things I'd like to do
---------------------

* Not get busted or banned from Craigslist
* Group Cities into States and Zones
* Finish OptionParser implementation / Actually use options in search
* SQL integration
  - store results for retrieval later
  - spider multiple times a day but only show new results
  - stats? 
* Scheduled searches
* Sweet HTML Output
* Documentation
* Maybe, _just maybe_, write some tests ;)
